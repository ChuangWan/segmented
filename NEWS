*********************************


===============
version 0.2-8.1
===============
* Some minor bugs fixed (segmented.lm and segmented.glm were not working correctly with subsetted datasets or when the starting 
	linear model included several intercepts (e.g., see the example about data("plant"), thanks to Nicola Ferrari for finding the error); 
	davies.test() did not work when the variable name of its argument `seg.Z' included reserved words, e.g. `seg.Z~dist'. thanks to Thom 
	White for finding the error). 


===============
version 0.2-8
===============
* intercept() added. It computes the intercepts of the regression lines for each segment of the fitted segmented relationship.
* plot.segmented() now accepts a vector `col' argument to draw the fitted piecewise linear relationships with different colors.
* Some minor bugs fixed (summary.segmented were not working correctly). 


===============
version 0.2-7.3
===============
* argument APC added to the slope() function to compute the `annual percent change'.
* Some minor bugs fixed (confint and slope were not working correctly when the estimated breakpoints were returned
	in non-increasing order; offset was ignored in segmented.lm and segmented.glm; broken.line() was not working correctly
	(and its argument gap was unimplemented), thanks to M. Rennie for pointing out that; 
	summary.segmented() was not working for models with no linear term, i.e. fitted via segmented(lm(y~0),..)).


===============
version 0.2-7.2
===============
* segmented.lm and segmented.glm now accept objects with formulas y~., Thanks to G. Ferrara for finding the error. 
* Some bugs fixed (slope and confint were using the normal (rather than the t-distribution) to compute the CIs 
	in gaussian models).


===============
version 0.2-7.1
===============
* segmented.lm and segmented.glm now accept objects without 'explicit' formulas, namely returned by lm(my_fo,..) (and glm(my_fo,..)) where
	my_fo was defined earlier. Thanks to Y. Iwasaki for finding the error.


===============
version 0.2-7
===============
* A sort of automatic procedure for breakpoint estimation is implemented. See argument
	stop.if.error in seg.control().
* davies.test() now accepts a one-sided formula (~x) rather than character ("x") to mean the
	segmented variable to be tested. davies.test also gains the arguments `beta0' and `dispersion'.
* Some bugs fixed.


===============
version 0.2-6
===============
* vcov.segmented() added.
* option var.diff for robust covariance matrix has been added in summary.segmented, print.summary.segmented, slope, and confint.
* Some bugs fixed.
