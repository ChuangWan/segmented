*	Changes in segmented	  *
*					  *
*********************************


==============
version 0.2-7.2
==============
* segmented.lm and segmented.glm now accept objects with formulas y~., Thanks to G. Ferrara for finding the error. 
* Some bugs fixed (slope and confint were using the normal (rather than the t-distribution) to compute the CIs 
	in gaussian models)


==============
version 0.2-7.1
==============
* segmented.lm and segmented.glm now accept objects without 'explicit' formulas, namely returned by lm(my_fo,..) (and glm(my_fo,..)) where
	my_fo was defined earlier. Thanks to Y. Iwasaki for finding the error.


==============
version 0.2-7
==============
* A sort of automatic procedure for breakpoint estimation is implemented. See argument
	stop.if.error in seg.control()
* davies.test() now accepts a one-sided formula (~x) rather than character ("x") to mean the
	segmented variable to be tested. davies.test also gains the arguments `beta0' and `dispersion'
* Some bugs fixed


==============
version 0.2-6
==============
* vcov.segmented added
* option var.diff for robust covariance matrix has been added in summary.segmented, print.summary.segmented, slope, and confint.
* Some bugs fixed
